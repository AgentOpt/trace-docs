# Getting Started with Trace2

Welcome! This guide will help you install, configure, and start using Trace2.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:
- ✅ Install Trace2 and its dependencies
- ✅ Configure LLM backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- ✅ Build your first optimizable function
- ✅ Run your first optimization

## Installation (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install trace-opt
```

That's it! Trace2 is now installed.

## Set Up Your API Key (1 minute)

```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'
```

## Your First Example (2 minutes)

```python
from opto.trace import node, bundle
from opto.optimizers import OptoPrime

@bundle(trainable=True)
def greet(name):
    """Greet the user."""
    return f"Hey {name}"

optimizer = OptoPrime(greet.parameters())

# Optimize the greeting to be more professional
output = greet("Alice")
feedback = "Make it more professional and formal"

optimizer.zero_feedback()
optimizer.backward(output, feedback)
optimizer.step()

# Try again
print(greet("Alice"))  # Should be more formal now!
```
