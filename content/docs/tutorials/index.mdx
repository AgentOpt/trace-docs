# Tutorials

Learn Trace2 through hands-on, step-by-step tutorials.

## Getting Started with Tutorials

These tutorials will guide you through building AI systems with Trace2, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

{/* Tutorials will appear here after running the notebook converter */}

## Available Tutorials

Run the notebook converter to generate tutorials from the Trace2 examples:

```bash
npm run docs:convert-notebooks
```

This will convert all Jupyter notebooks from the Trace2 repository into interactive tutorials.

## Learning Path

We recommend following this learning path:

1. **Beginner**: Start with the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide
2. **Intermediate**: Build your first agent
3. **Advanced**: Explore multi-agent systems and complex workflows

## Interactive Examples

All tutorials include:
- ✅ Complete, runnable code examples
- ✅ Step-by-step explanations
- ✅ "Open in Colab" badges for interactive exploration
- ✅ Expected outputs and results
